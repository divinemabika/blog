        <p>Hey there guys!</P>
          <p>I’m Divne and welcome to my blog.  So, a little bit about me, I was born and bred in London and I come from a big family. I have 5 sisters and 1 brother. I love a great adventure, I love food, I love my family and friends, I love solo travelling and most importantly I love God.
           <br>
            <br>
            This blog is about my crazy life and a lot of random thoughts and experiences. I want to share with you the wonders of the world through my adventures and share not only the best places to go, but to share with you the experiences I’ve had with local people.
             <br>
              <br>
              This blog is not just about my travels but my inner thoughts, which include a bit of fantasy writing and a bunch of random things such as my love for bread. When I was in China I fell even more in love with BREAD! They have such a great variety,
               I don’t even know where to begin, but don’t worry I will share with you all my secrets.
                <br>
                <br>
                This blog is to tell you what most people don’t, it not designed to tell you about the beautiful sites and gorgeous architecture but about the amazing people you see, the people you speak to and the lifelong friends you will eventually make. Remember you never forget how people make you feel.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                Also, I would also appreciate it if  you have a story to share, because I would love to hear it! So, if you want to share… go to the share section and you will be heard.
                  So have fun reading and share!</p>
